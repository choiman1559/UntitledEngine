BashVenture - Adventure for Bash
=================================

You are in a git repository. Code surrounds you. There are directories to the north, south, east, and west.<br>There is a README file here!


Introduction
------------

One of the very first computer games I played was Colossal Cave, aka 'Adventure'. Widely regarded as one of THE original classic text-based adventure games, pre-dating Zork and others, it set the scene for a new era of human-computer interaction and inspired countless software developers to build things that had a more human touch.

In this age of high-performance graphics and hyper-realistic gameplay, I think it's important to remember that a cleverly told story beats a well-rendered polygon any day.

That's why I build BashVenture. I wanted a way to bring back a bit of life into the text-based adventure game format, without the need to be an expert coder. BashVenture is a simple set of easy-to-edit scripts and logic files that you can re-word and re-engineer to create games as simple or as complex as you like.

Play the demo, fork the repo, and have a go at making an immersive, well-told adventure of your own! All I ask is that you link back here in the game introduction, so that others can see how easy it is to make a game of their own too.
